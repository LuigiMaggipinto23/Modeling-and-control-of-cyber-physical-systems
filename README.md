# Modeling-and-control-of-cyber-physical-systems
In this project, through the use of Matlab and Simulink, we apply the mathematical models and different algorithms to estimate the state of a system, possibly in the presence of sensors attacks. In particular, we consider problems of target localization, in a two-dimensional indoor area. 

# Modeling part
We start implementing the Iterative Shrinkage‚ÄêThresholding Operator (IST) to secure estimation under sparse sensor attacks, solving the Lasso Problem. In the report below we have analysed the results in different scenarios.

# Control part
